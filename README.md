## Peter Yezek - Comm 3159-01 </h2>

##### Brett P. Foreman </h5>

###### My favorite things I learned this semester: </h6>
* JQuery *(My Favorite)*
* GitHub
* More HTML elements
###### Things that I already knew about: </h6>
1. Most terminology
2. Basic computer networks
3. How to use HTML and CSS *(What I was most familiar with)*

  The most fun I had on an assingment outside of class was learning **WordPress**!
Being able to create a fan site was way more enjoyable than I ever thought it would be. Here is the link to the page I made: https://weblab.uni.edu/foremanb/wordpress/

Here is one of the graphics I put on my page:

In regards to my page, my friend Ben said:
>This is a really nice page! I love the graphics.

\* I really thought his site was better \* :wink: :+1: :star: :football:

One thing I learned to enjoy much better than before in this class is simply coding.
```javascript
function test() {
 console.log("I love to code!!");
}
```
This class made coding not awful for me.
